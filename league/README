A fresh install will include two template files in your '.config'
directory. 'config.php.template' and 'bzlsql.php.template' should be 
renamed to remove the '.template' suffix.  Edit both files according 
to your SQL setup and preferences.  

SQL configuration for all scripts and php (including the website) is
defined in '(webroot)/.config/bzlsql.php'.  Make sure it contains the
proper information, and is executable!

To create all SQL table for a new installation, 'cd' to the 
'support/sqlscripts/create_new_install' directory and run './runme.sh'.

runme.sh is a shell script which performs all operations needed for a
new install. It will DELETE ALL TABLES first, then create the required
tables. 

It will also create one user account (callsign:'admin', password: 'admin')
with full admin priviledges.  After running the script, login to the 
website, and change the password (and callsign if desired) using the
'[Profile]' link at the top of any page.
