Please note that as some player names have slashes in them, that Apache by default blocks the encoding of slashes.

to work around this, we enable `AllowEncodedSlashes On` at the virtual directory level.

The application encodes them just fine, and will route them just fine, and there is no security issue with them - so it's safe to enable them


alias/virtual server config:
Please note that "AllowOverride" and "Options" settings:
	"AllowOverride All"
	"Options FollowSylinks"

apache Virtual Server Example:
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@domain.com
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/BzStatsWeb/webroot"
    ServerName mydomainname
    AllowEncodedSlashes On

    ErrorLog "logs/BzStatsWeb-error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/BzStatsWeb-access.log" common

    <Directory "/var/www/BzStatsWeb/webroot">
        AllowOverride All
        Options FollowSymLinks
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


Qore's included .htaccess file in the webroot gives friendly URL's, and routes everything properly to index.php.

If you would rather 'alias' the webroot from an existing site (meaning it will not be served from the site's root)
then you must set it up as follows:


alias /myAlias "/path/to/project/webroot"
<Location /myAlias>
    Options FollowSymLinks
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    AllowEncodedSlashes On

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On

        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [PT,L]
    </IfModule>
</Location>
